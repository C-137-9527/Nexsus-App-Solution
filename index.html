          Your one stop shop for a <span>custom</span> app made for your needs.

        <p>
          Are you tired of using a generic, one size fits all apps that don’t
          quite meet your business needs? If so, then Nexus is the solution for
          you.

            <h2>Why do you need your own app?</h2>
            <p>
              A custom mobile app allows you to engage with your customers in a
              way that a website or social media platform can't. You can send
              push notifications about special offers, promotions, and events,
              keeping your customers informed and engaged. You can also create
              loyalty programs, reward customers for their repeat business, and
              gather valuable feedback through in-app surveys.

            <h2>Increase revenue and ROI</h2>
            <p>
              Increased customer engagement means customers are more likely to
              buy from you or engage your services. This translates into higher
              revenue, profits, and ultimately ROI. At Nexus, we believe that
              you don’t have to spend a fortune to have an app that is made
              specifically for you. With an efficient project management
              process, we can help you keep costs down and maximize ROI, all the
              while keeping app quality high.

            <h3>1. Gather Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              We will start by understanding the business goals you want the app
              to help you achieve. Then, we will develop use cases to try to
              understand how different users will use the app. This will help
              inform what functionalities should be implemented and how they
              will be implemented.

            <h3>2. Interactive Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
              After the initial requirements gathering and before we do any
              actual development, we will make an interactive visual prototype
              for you. This prototype will allow you to see how the resulting
              app will behave and how different screens flow into one another.

            <h3>3. Go or no go?</h3>
            <p>
              After the first prototype is developed, you can review and
              interact with it. If you are happy with the prototype, you can
              decide to go ahead with the next step in the development journey.

              interact with it. If you are happy with the prototype, you can

            <h3>5. Prototype Evolution</h3>
            <p>
              After a prototype is finished, you will have a chance to test and
              evaluate it. If you are satisfied with it, it can be primed for
              release after rigorous testing and quality assurance. If you need
              further changes, the prototype can be further evolved to take new
              requirements into account.

              interact with it. If you are happy with the prototype, you can
